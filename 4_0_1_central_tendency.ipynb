        "\n",
        "**Central Tendency:** Central tendency refers to the statistical measures that identify the center of a data distribution. These measures aim to summarize the entire dataset by providing a single representative value. The three most commonly used measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mean (Arithmetic Average):**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Definition:** The mean is the sum of all data points divided by the number of data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Formula:**\n",
        "   Mean=\n",
        "‚àëx i / N\n",

        "ùëÅ\n",
        " is the number of data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Usefulness:** The mean is sensitive to every value in the dataset, meaning that extreme values (outliers) can significantly influence the mean. For example, in a dataset of salaries, a few extremely high salaries could distort the mean, making it appear higher than the majority of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitations:** When data has outliers or is skewed, the mean might not be a good representation of the \"central\" value. For example, the average income in a region might not reflect the typical income of most individuals if there are a few very wealthy people.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Usefulness:** The median is robust to outliers because it depends only on the middle value(s) of the ordered data. This makes it a better measure of central tendency when the dataset is skewed or contains extreme values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitations:** The median does not account for the magnitude of values on either side, meaning it doesn't reflect the overall distribution of the data as well as the mean.\n",

        "**Mode (Most Frequent Value):**\n",

        "\n",
        "**Usefulness:** The mode is useful in identifying the most common value in categorical data or when determining the most frequent event in a series of observations. For example, in a survey, the mode might represent the most common response or the most frequent category.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitations:** The mode can be misleading if the data set has multiple values occurring with the same frequency (multimodal), or no value occurs more frequently than others.\n"
